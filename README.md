# typescript-html-canvas 
### A game made using HTML5 canvas and Typescript 

This is nothing special. This is just me trying to learn how HTML5 canvas and Typescript works. I
know Typescript is not used for game development, but I just wanted to learn by doing something that
I enjoy more than building websites. Here are the instructions for you if you want to try this game
out:

**Prerequisites:**

- Node
- Git
- (Preferably) Latest version of Firefox/Google Chrome

**Commands:**

```bash
npm install -g typescript http-server
git clone https://github.com/ritchielrez/typescript-html-canvas
cd typescript-html-canvas
tsc
http-server -p 8080
```

Then open up your browser and go to `localhost:8080` to play the game ðŸ˜ƒ
